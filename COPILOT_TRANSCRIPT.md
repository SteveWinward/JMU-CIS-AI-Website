# Copilot Session Transcript

This file captures the Copilot (assistant) session for the repository JMU-CIS-AI-Website. It includes user requests, assistant actions, and a concise record of file changes and plans made during the session.

## Session start

- Date: 2025-09-17
- Assistant identity: GitHub Copilot

---

## Conversation (chronological summary)

1. User: "I need to create an asp.net website from the requirements document which is provided in REQUIREMENTS.md... build an asp.net application and put source code in a new folder called 'src'... guide me through how to test the website from a GitHub codespace so that I can test the website from my local machine."

2. Assistant: Reviewed `REQUIREMENTS.md` and proposed a plan. Created a todo list and then scaffolded an ASP.NET Core MVC application in `src/NonProfitSite` including:
   - Project file: `NonProfitSite.csproj`
   - Program and startup: `Program.cs`, `Program.Host.cs`
   - App settings: `appsettings.json`
   - EF Core DbContext: `Data/AppDbContext.cs`
   - Seed data: `Data/SeedData.cs`
   - Models: `Models/Feedback.cs`, `Models/Event.cs`, `Models/NewsItem.cs`, `Models/AdminUser.cs`, `Models/FeedbackViewModel.cs`
   - Services: `Services/IEmailSender.cs`, `Services/ConsoleEmailSender.cs`
   - Controllers: `Controllers/HomeController.cs`, `Controllers/AdminController.cs`
   - Views and layout: `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`, `Views/Home/*`, `Views/Admin/*`
   - Static assets: `wwwroot/css/site.css`, `wwwroot/images/*`
   - README: `src/NonProfitSite/README.md` with Codespaces testing instructions

   Assistant reported progress via the task list and marked each todo item completed as work progressed.

3. User: "please add automated tests"

4. Assistant: Added an xUnit test project at `src/NonProfitSite.Tests` with:
   - `NonProfitSite.Tests.csproj` referencing the main project
   - `IntegrationTests.cs` using `WebApplicationFactory<Program>`, with in-memory EF Core DB, testing home page and feedback submission
   - Added `Program.Host.cs` to facilitate `WebApplicationFactory` usage (partial Program declaration)

5. User: "please convert all of the code from dotnet 7.0 to dotnet 8.0 and update README"

6. Assistant: Updated project targets and package versions:
   - `NonProfitSite.csproj` target to `net8.0`, updated EF packages to 8.0
   - `NonProfitSite.Tests.csproj` target to `net8.0`, updated test packages
   - Updated `src/NonProfitSite/README.md` to reference .NET 8 SDK download and testing instructions

   The assistant also handled a package restore issue for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies` (removed explicit package reference since it is supplied by the shared framework) and fixed a test SDK version mismatch by setting `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` to a published stable version.

7. User: Asked how to run the website in GitHub Codespaces and expose it to view from local machine.

8. Assistant: Provided step-by-step instructions: run `dotnet run` in `src/NonProfitSite`, forward port 5000 in Codespaces Ports view, set visibility public or open in browser; recommended ensuring the app listens on `0.0.0.0:5000` (the project configures this), included notes on security and troubleshooting.

9. User: Requested a polished purple & gold themed homepage with AI-generated images.

10. Assistant: Reworked the home page with a polished design and purple/gold theme:
    - Updated `wwwroot/css/site.css` with theme variables, hero and card styles
    - Updated `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` to add Google Fonts and navbar adjustments
    - Replaced `Views/Home/Index.cshtml` with new hero, feature cards, news and events layout
    - Added placeholder SVG images in `wwwroot/images` (community.svg, mission.svg, volunteer.svg, donate.svg)
    - Provided instructions for replacing these placeholders with AI-generated images and guidance on prompts and workflow

11. User: "please produce photorealistic ai images"

12. Assistant: Provided high-quality prompts, negative prompts, model and sampler recommendations, resolution/aspect recommendations, and post-processing tips for generating photorealistic AI images (advice only â€” assistant did not generate images directly).

13. User: Asked to add an admin link on the main home page

14. Assistant: Inserted a visible "Staff / Admin" gold-styled link in the hero CTAs of `Views/Home/Index.cshtml` linking to `/Admin/Login`.

15. User: Asked to update to Bootstrap styling

16. Assistant: Enhanced Bootstrap usage and validation across views:
    - Added Bootstrap form validation script to `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
    - Updated admin login and create-admin views to use Bootstrap card layout and `.needs-validation`
    - Updated `Views/Home/Contact.cshtml` to use `form-floating` and validation

17. User: Noted _Layout wasn't applied to Index. Assistant added `Views/_ViewStart.cshtml` with `Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml"` so views use the shared layout by default.

18. User: Asked to save the entire Copilot transcript as a Markdown file. Assistant created this file: `COPILOT_TRANSCRIPT.md` at the repository root (this file).

19. User: Asked for photorealistic images and further guidance; assistant provided prompt sets and instructions on how to generate and integrate them.

20. User: Asked to add Admin link and further Bootstrap improvements; assistant updated views accordingly.

21. Additional tasks done during the session include:
    - Fixes for package restore errors (removed an explicit cookie package reference and fixed test SDK version)
    - Created integration tests and supporting infrastructure
    - Ensured Program partial exists to support test host

If you want an exact raw export of every message (timestamps, message metadata and tool outputs) rather than this session summary, say so and I will generate a verbatim chronological log including all assistant messages, user messages, and notable tool outputs.
